The system consists of two user roles: Administrator and User.

Administrator Capabilities:

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Users: 
The administrator has full control over user management. 
They can create new users, view user details, update user information, and delete user accounts.
CRUD Products: The administrator has complete control over product management. 
They can add new products, view product details, modify product information, and delete products from the system.

User Capabilities:

Create Products: Regular users, known as "User" in the system, can create new products. 
They have the ability to add product information and contribute to the product database.
No Delete Access: Users do not have the ability to delete products or perform any deletion operations on the system. 
Deletion capabilities are restricted to administrators only.
This role-based access control system allows the administrator to have full administrative privileges, while regular users have limited access, focusing primarily on product creation. 
This approach ensures that sensitive operations like deletion are only performed by authorized personnel, promoting data security and control within the application.
